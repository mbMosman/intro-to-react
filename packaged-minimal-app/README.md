# packaged-minimal-app

This takes the `minimal-react-app` and moves it into a Node.js package using `react-scripts` to run and build the project. This uses Webpack under the hood, a tool that many web developers are already familiar with.

> Note: This is similar to what you'll get if you use [create react app](https://create-react-app.dev/), but with a little less clutter.

## Other packaging options

You could certainly package the application in other ways. For example, you could use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) which might feel more familiar to those who work with Vue 3 for example.
