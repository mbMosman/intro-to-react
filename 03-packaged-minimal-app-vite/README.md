# packaged-minimal-app-vite

This takes the `minimal-react-app` and moves it into a Node.js package using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) to run and build the project.

> Note: This is similar to what you'll get if you use the command: 
```
npm create vite@latest vite-react-app -- --template react
```

## Other packaging options

You could certainly package the application in other ways. For example, you could use on of the various [React Frameworks](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) or stick with the older style of React build using Webpack, similar to [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/).
