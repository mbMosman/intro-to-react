# Intro to React

These are a few sample projects used to introduce React to new web developers. 

- `00-basic-javascript-app` a simple vanilla JS app to render "Hello, world!" to the DOM.
- `01-minimal-react-app` brings in React from a CDN, creating a simple App component to render "Hello, world!" to the DOM.
- `02-packaged-minimal-app` bundles the previous version of the app into a Node.js package similar to what you get from Create React App, using tools like Webpack under the hood.
- `03-packaged-minimal-app-vite` bundles the previous version of the app into a Node.js package using Vite.
- `04-learning-react-structure` a more traditional version of the Hello World app using JSX.
- `05-learning-react-dynamic-data` explores how to use JS in JSX to make data dynamic.
- `06-learning-react-component-props` explores how to define and validate component props.
- `07-learning-react-component-state` explores how to define and use state and update it with event handlers.
