# Intro to React

These are a few sample projects used to introduce React to new web developers. 

- `minimal-react-app` brings in React from a CDN, creating a simple App component to render "Hello, world!" to the DOM.
- `packaged-minimal-app` bundles the previous version of the app into a Node.js package similar to what you get from Create React App, using tools like Webpack under the hood.
- `packaged-minimal-app-vite` bundles the previous version of the app into a Node.js package using Vite.
